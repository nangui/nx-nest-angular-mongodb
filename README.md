## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `yarn nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `yarn nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
yarn nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

## Start Api and Angular app

```
yarn run:all
```

## Start only api
